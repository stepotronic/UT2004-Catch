This is a Mutator for Unreal Tournament 2004 that I wrote a while ago. You play a last man standing like game where one has to catch and touch another player or you lose hitpoints over time. You start with a configurable amount of lifes and if you could not catch somebody in time you die and lose a life. The player surviving the longest wins the match.


I want to share it since I think it is a lot of fun and should be played more often.
